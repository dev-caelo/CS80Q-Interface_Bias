# Introduction

Hello there! I published this website as a final PSA project for Stanford's CS80Q under Cynthia Lee. The project focuses on widely found interface biases on the Internet,
ranging from accessibility to inclusion concerns.

I built this page using Bootstrap, Javascript, <s>and a lot of patience with Bootstrap</s>.

## References

Throughout this project, I consulted [Cynthia Lee](https://profiles.stanford.edu/48960) and [E](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egthegreat/) about various forms of biases that
they have encountered directly.

When writing about biases in online account creation / editing forms, I reference this article published by [Sabrina Fonseca](https://uxdesign.cc/designing-forms-for-gender-diversity-and-inclusion-d8194cf1f51).

Additionally, when writing about system-wide name-change limitation problems, I reference this article published by [Penelope Phippen](https://dev.to/penelope_zone/changing-your-name-is-a-hard-unsolved-problem-in-computer-science-kjf).
